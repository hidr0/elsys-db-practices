## Grading
- From the folder `./assignments/` download the files which have your number on them.

- Please copy this legend into a file with the name, grade and upload it.

```
hash-YOURNUMBER.txt
```

- Please write explanations on each 0 you put. If you do not put an explanation a point will be deducted from your score.

- Please be careful when grading the queries you will need to add/remove/update data in order to figure out if it is actually working.

- The way that you should grade is in parallel. You open the three examples you need to grade and grade the first 3 criteria, then you move to the next criteria.

## The criteria is this:
